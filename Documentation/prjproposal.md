# Preemptive Collection,Categorization,Analysis and Forensic Preservation of Social Media Content via APIs
    Collecting posts,comments reviews based on an event/keyword around a set time frame. 
    more preemptive focus. Analysing data and categorizing before storing digital evidence(at this time its more indicator than evidence,warrents further look). Said evidence can further be forensically analysed.


## Implementation:
- Collect data via social media apis
- Filter based on relevance
- Categorization
- Storage(structure)
- Integrity(logging, hashing)
- Review(determination)
- Forensic media analysis*

## Literature review
- Social Media Forensics
- API based data collection
- Analysis/filtering*
- Digital evidence collection

## Questions thesis could address
- When does it become digital evidence?
- Standards for cases
- Preemptive collection of data,ie before an investigation/assessment is launched
- Use cases
- methodology of analysis and "filtering"

## Use cases
- Cybercrime(abuse surrounding a sports event)
- Misinformation
- social media sentiment analysis(less need for forensically storing data, not less just not as serious)
- slander/defamation
## Still left to decide
- Implementation
    - Do we all focus on one api and multiple use cases(more depth)
    - Multiple apis with multiple use cases(less depth but greatter scope)
    - multiple different use cases may require multiple different methodology, how do we do this without undermining our own established methodology or do we come up with multiple different ones
