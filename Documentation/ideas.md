# Ideas
Potential ideas for the big project.

## 1)Post AI Bubble: Repurposing of GPU Infrastructure

    We can div it up into where we are right now, where it looks like we are going and what would happen if we got there.
- introduction

- economic side
    - "Learning" from previous mistakes(ie dot com and 2008). 
    - Similarities
    - Facts
    - Future

- History
    - AI
    - GPU

- potential repurposed uses
    - military
    - education
    - research
    - media
    - scraping

- work
    - aqquizition of hardware(GPU)
    - forensic analysis
    - report
    - decommisioning

- conclusion

## 2)OSINT and forensic collection of digital evidence

    Using open source inteligence to filter for/analysing and collect digital evidence.
Increase in osint and adding a digital forensics layer.

Thesis will cover:
- OSINT
- Forensics
- SocialMedia
- API
- Additional ?

Implementation: 
    Using social media apis to request for data using a keyword and timeframe. 
- API for each platfor
- JSON structure with python
- Data analysis
- Filtering for relevant data
- FTK imager/toolkit ?

so a prg would request info via api, we come up with our own filters,
we take this evidence, store it(timestamps and so on), analyse media using FTK imager
